# SSL/HTTPS configuration
# Netlify automatically provides SSL certificates for custom domains
# Ensure your domain DNS is correctly configured:
# - Add a CNAME record pointing to your Netlify site
# - Or add an A record for apex domain
# Then enable SSL in Netlify dashboard: Site settings > Domain management > HTTPS
